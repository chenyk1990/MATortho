This is a repository to hold the Matlab version of the local orthogonalization method and the local similarity measurement (for detecting signal leakage) introduced in:

Chen and Fomel, 2015, Random noise attenuation using local signal-and-noise orthogonalization, Geophysics, WD1-WD9.

Since March, 19, 2023, this official site of Matlab-version local orthogonalization package has been moved to https://github.com/aaspip/MATortho. The current site of the package is no longer maintained.
